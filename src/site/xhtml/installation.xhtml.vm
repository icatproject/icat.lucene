	<h1>
		<a id="installation"></a> Installation
	</h1>
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The icat lucene server distribution: <a
			href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/icat.lucene/${project.version}/icat.lucene-${project.version}-distro.zip">icat.lucene-${project.version}-distro.zip</a>
		</li>
		<li>Java 11+</li>
		<li>A suitable deployed application server that supports JakartaEE 10+. Testing has been carried out with Payara Server Community 6. Other applications servers such as GlassFish and WildFly may work but have not been tested.
			<a href="https://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Glassfish installation instructions</a> are available.
		</li>
		<li>Python 3.6+</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The setup.properties file</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>container</dt>
		<dd>
			Values must be chosen from: <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/api/2.6/org/eclipse/persistence/config/TargetServer.html">TargetServer</a>
			Though only Glassfish is working properly at the moment.
		</dd>
		<dt>home</dt>
		<dd>is the top level of the container installation. For Glassfish
			it must contain "glassfish/domains" and for JBoss (wildfly) it must
			contain jboss-modules.jar.</dd>
		<dt>port</dt>
		<dd>is the administration port of the container which is
			typically 4848 for Glassfish and 9990 for JBoss.</dd>
		<dt>secure</dt>
		<dd>must be set to true or false. If true then only https and not
			http connections will be allowed.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>The logback.xml file</h2>

	<p>If you wish to modify the provided logging levels then rename
		logback.xml.example to logback.xml and edit to suit.</p>

	<h2>The run.properties file</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>directory</dt>
		<dd>The path to a directory (whose parent must exist) in which to
			store the lucene index. Any environment variables will be respected.</dd>

		<dt>commitSeconds</dt>
		<dd>the interval in seconds between committing lucene changes to
			disk and updating the index.</dd>

		<dt>maxShardSize</dt>
		<dd>The maximum number of documents to store in a single index before "sharding"
			into an additional index. All sharded indices are searched at once when
			performing a search. Has a maximum value of 2147483648 (max int + 1).</dd>

		<dt>ip</dt>
		<dd>Ranges of ip addresses to accept requests from. This should
			be as restrictive as possible - just list the icats you need to
			listen to. Provide a space separated list of allowed values. These
			take the form of an IPV4 or IPV6 address followed by the number of
			bits (starting from the most significant) to consider. For example
			127.0.0.1/32 is the IPV4 value for localhost.</dd>

		<dt>units</dt>
		<dd>Recognised unit names/symbols. Each symbol recognised by indriya's
			SimpleUnitFormat should be followed by a colon, and then a comma separated
			list of units measuring the same property. If the unit is simply an alias
			(e.g. "K: kelvin") this is sufficient. If a conversion is required, it
			should be followed by this factor (e.g. "J: eV 1.602176634e-19"). Different
			units can be separated by a semi-colon.</dd>

		<dt>aggregateFiles</dt>
		<dd>Aggregate file sizes/counts for Datasets and Investigations as Datafiles are
			added or modified (i.e. in real time). This can have a significant
			performance impact when writing to the index. If "false", icat.server can
			instead be configured to update sizes at a regular intervals.</dd>
	</dl>
